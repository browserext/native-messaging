      Various applications of <a href="///browserext.github.io/browserext/">Browser Extensions</a>
      need a mechanism to communicate with local client native processes outside of the browser environment.
      This specification proposes such a mechanism.

          <p>Implementation of the technologies discussed and specified in this Community Group is ongoing
          and none of the original contributors have expressed opposition
          to this work.
          However, due to various circumstances,
          the level of participation has drooped below the level
          at which productive discussion is possible,
          and this group has become dormant as a result.

          <p>The specifications have therefore not been maintained in a while,

          Issues can be raised and comments can be added to existing ones,
          but timely responses are unlikely at best.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Browser Extensions Community Group's goal is to make browser extension code much more interoperable across browsers by specifying common extension interfaces and well-defined browser behavior. </p>
      <p>This specification defines the interfaces and behavior which enables extensions to communicate with local client native processes outside of the browser environment.</p>
      <p>It is not a goal of this specification to define:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The mechanism a browser would use to communicate with the local client native process (e.g. stdio)</li>
            <li>The registration specifics of how a browser would locate the local client native process app, service, or binary executable</li>
            <li>The specifics of how a browser would manage the lifetime of local client native process</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class='informative'>
        <h2>Native Application Registration</h2>
        <p>Extensions using the native messaging APIs identify a native application with which they wish to communciate using a string identifier.  A browser that implements native messaging must also define a method for mapping a string identifier to a native application.  This method MUST allow the browser to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locate the associated native component on the local client</li>
            <li>Start the native process when needed</li>
            <li>Exchange messages containing JSON serializable data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The method for identifying and communicating with native processes MAY also do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Establish a limit on the size of messages sent both to and from the native application, to avoid resource exhaustion</li>
            <li>Define a method for exchanging additional types of messages (i.e., data that is not JSON serializable)</li>
            <li>Impose access control, allowing the mapping for a particular native application to be restricted to a set of specified extensions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each browser implementation may have different mechanisms for registration, message filtering and lifetime management of the local client native process.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='informative'>
        <h2>Core APIs</h2>
        <p>The goal for these APIs is to provide functionality that extension authors need for message-passing between extensions and local client native process outside of the browser. Methods are provided for both establishing long-lived connection ports and for sending individual "one-shot" messages.</p>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    In addition to the base functionality of the <code>browser.runtime</code> object defined in the [[!browserext]] Browser Extensions specification, these additional APIs provide functionaly for Native Messaging.

                    The <code>"nativeMessaging"</code> permission is required to use these additional APIs.

              <dl>
                <dt><code>connectNative()</code></dt>
                <dd>This function attempts to establish a long-lived connection with the application identified by <code>nativeServiceName</code>.  The process by which the requested native application is identified and communication is established is outside of the scope of this document, as detailed above.  A <code>BrowserExtRuntimePort</code> object is immediately returned.  If the requested application does not exist or communication cannot be established for any reason, the <code>error</code> property of the returned object will be non-null.</dd>

                <dt><code>sendNativeMessage()</code></dt>
                <dd>This function attemps to establish a temporary connection with the application identified by <code>nativeServiceName</code> and transmit the provided <code>message</code> to it.  If communication with the specified application cannot be established, the returned Promise is rejected with an appropriate error.  If communication is established, the returned Promise is resolved with the contents of the first message sent from the native application to the browser.  After the returned Promise is settled, the logical connection established by this function is longer accessible, an extension must call <code>connectNative()</code> or <code>sendNativeMessage()</code> again to conduct further communication.  Though note that the logical connection need not be tied to the lifetime of an individual process on the client, different browsers may choose to manage processes differently.</dd>
